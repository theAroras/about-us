## Questions that may be asked by the public

### What exactly is this?

> This is just a simple declaration of **@theAroras**, our organization. Not too big, not too small.

### What does this organization exactly do?

> We, as the @theAroras, want to create the best of repositories. Even though we may be noob programmers, we can still create some awesome, yet okay programs.

### Who is in this organization?

>We are, of course. No, I’m just kidding — I, **@amayarora**, and **@aryamanarora*** make up this whole, entire organization, @theAroras.

### I’m a noob programmer — Can I join this organization then?

> Sorry, but we, @theAroras, will not invite anymore people, and, even if we did, we would only invite people who are related to us, and use GitHub.

### What is “dabbing” exactly?

> Did you happen to read this in our description for this organization, @theAroras? Anyway, dabbing is quite popular at our school we go to — It is basically when you have your hands in such a position, as if you were “dabbing” your head inside a gigantic, metallic bucket, and your arms represented the edges of the gigantic bucket.

## Our mission

> We, as **@theAroras**, want to prove ourselves to create awesome repositories, Gists, Wikis, projects, issues, etc. on GitHub, despite the fact we are noob programmers. If a repository we have on our organization, @theAroras, is public, then we would like to make that particular repository the best repository we can make it, and make it very entertaining.

Thank you for reading this **README.md**, and we, as @theAroras, very much appreciate it.
